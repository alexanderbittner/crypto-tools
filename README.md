# crypto-tools

A collection of tools created for the cryptography course at RUB. If you would like to contribute, feel free to do so!
*PLEASE NOTE: These tools are not intended for secure encryption of files. The implementations are just for educational purposes.*

## ROADMAP

These tools are on the roadmap to being included:

- Euclidean Algorithm
- Extended Euclidean Algorithm
- Square and Multiply
- Euler's Phi Function
- Prime Factorization
- Order calculator
- DES encrypt & decrypt
- AES encrypt & decrypt
- RSA functionality
- ECC tooling
- Hashing
- stream ciphers
- LFSRs
- old stuff, such as rot13
